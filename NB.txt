New Activity? NEW SCREEN
1 - New class with a new name
2 - XML file

1. Phone will look for ANDROIDMANIFEST.XML first
2. Look for activity attribute
3. Java says go to activity_main and launched the layout (for me = HOME)

Java: The Professional
Resources: The Artist
AndroidManifest.xml: The Boss
Intent: The Job itself
